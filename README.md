#_Web Dev Portfolio Page_

_ This Webpage is about a simple minimal-style Web Dev Landing page for <br/>
Web developers._

By_**Josh Hortt**_

## Description

_The purpose of this Webpage is to give share a Dev Portfolio page to showcase <br/>
everything I do online and I wanted it to be beautiful, clean and minimal and <br/>
right to the point rather hyper designed. And I think most of the developers <br/>
out there would want the same._ <br/>

_So I looked deeply every where on the Internet and found a few good ideas._

## Themes

_My own Web Dev Portfolio Landing Page comes in 6 **color gradient themes**, <br/>
which I like more then plain colors, because it gives this <br/>
**Modern Industrial High-Tech**Look to it!_

and create your own too._
